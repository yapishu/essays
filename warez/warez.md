# On the Scene

#### Review of *Warez: The Infrastructure and Aesthetics of Piracy* by Martin Paul Eve, Punctum Books 2021


`~sitful-hatred`

Our modes of engaging with the world flow organically from the constraints imposed by it. We understand intuitively that mass is bound by gravity, our subjectivity is bound to its point in space, and communication is governed by time and distance. Material scarcity, biological systems, and social forms follow procedurally from physical laws. Humans act on the world by recognizing these systems, encoding them as information, and exploiting their patterns. We extend our capabilities by coordinating with other agents, acting on the world as it is observed or conveyed to us, sharing our models, and arranging our own systems on top of the world we inhabit. 


The network is a metaphysical space with its own frame and emergent properties. Our ability to organize and operate is still catching up with its possibilities, but we learn about its boundaries by observing the edges. 


Digital space was created to collapse or suspend material constraints. Distance is compressed to latency at the edge of our perception, and temporal distance is primarily demarcated by aesthetic drift. Digital records are presented to the observer on equal footing -- tweets from this morning exist on the same horizontal plane as blog posts from 2012, textfiles from 1987, chat logs from 1996. Scarcity  shifts from nodes to edges, and paths between content become the focus of attention and curation. Some laws persist across the vale, though; entropy manifests as bitrot, inadequately distributed data vanishes with its hardware correlates.


A fundamental difference between the material world and the digital is the near-zero marginal cost to produce copies. An individual can 'possess' a file like a physical object, but he can replicate and distribute it in a way akin to magic. This characteristic undermines the notion of property -- a contradiction that went unresolved until the unveiling of Nakomoto consensus in 2009. In the decades prior, the dialectic between the legacy model of scarcity and digital abundance played out inside chat rooms and FTP servers.

Networks are agnostic to content by default. A gateway or switch simply passes packets between source and destination, and must be instructed to scrutinize or discriminate by their contents. Replication is also 'free'; a hard disk doesn't care what the bits it holds contain, a server doesn't care about where a transferred file originated. The confluence of these properties disrupts the reality of material scarcity and all that flows from it, including legacy property law regimes. The first decade of this century saw a nearly unrestrained proliferation of pirated content flood the public internet, tediously beaten back only through legal suppression, accommodation by the Megacorps that controlled the primary user-facing infrastructure, and a painful transition to digital distribution that gutted the Goliaths of the old world -- an overt recognition of network supremacy and the new laws. 


In the era between the old world and the network, when the laws of the network were largely unrecognized or ignored, a subculture took form around the exploitation of these contradictions. The Scene is above all an open-ended game; a para-economic competition between release groups, teams of individuals with a formalized division of labor. The game is played like this: media is produced and distributed through legitimate channels, sold to end consumers, and protected with software guardrails to prevent unauthorized copying. The Scene competes with *itself* to front-run this process, circumvent any protections, and distribute the stripped, formatted, and re-branded copy through a network of servers around the world. Velocity, volume, style, and quality are the metrics that are used to measure and quantify the prestige of a group. 


Beginning in the 1980s, and running until the present day, the Scene formed one of the earliest digital-native communities on BBS boards. BBSes -- 'bulletin board systems' akin to a forum or social network -- were the first exposure to networked computing that many early PC owners engaged with. Users literally dialed in to a remote server or PC, which may have in another state or country (invoking the corresponding long-distance fees). The first incarnation of the Scene took hold in these text-mode spaces, scattered servers with scrolling text art and megabytes of assembled media. These origins would leave a mark on the aesthetic signatures of the Scene in particular -- eighties-vintage graffiti motifs adorning text files are still produced and exchanged today, packaged with hundred-gigabyte Call of Duty games and 4K resolution Marvel movies. Beginning around 1994, and hastening after the police raid of the Park Central BBS in 1996 (a board with significant prominence), the BBS scene gave way to the Internet Scene as the old platform retreated into a historical note. Practices, standards, and software calcified in their new environment. 


When material scarcity no longer applies, resource competition shifts to what does remain scarce -- agents, and their metadata, reputation and prestige. The object of the competition is the same as the subcultural mode that was transposed onto the network; to be the most elite, to demonstrate abilities beyond the mortals outside the circle of honor, to generate standing for yourself and your group. Status games also function as cohesion mechanisms, establishing individual and corporate identity, and legible hierarchy in a disembodied, secretive, and frequently adversarial space.


The participants in this game, release groups, are pseudonymous groups of a skilled or resourceful elite among pirates. Release groups encode content according to formalized, written standards, and distribute it to hidden, exclusive servers (called 'topsites'). Topsites archive years and terabytes of historical releases, and run custom software stacks to monitor activity toward the end of scoring the game, and to grant recognition and prestige to the winners. The fundamental competition is to be first -- first to upload a coveted new album, first to crack a popular video game, first to relay a release from another topsite. The reward is infamy and access to topsites -- 'slots', scarce accounts that require deep investment to maintain. Downstream from this are competitions in distribution; lower-ranking members of release groups, or independent operators, known as 'couriers' make use of high-bandwidth connections and specialized tools to distribute the release to as many topsites as possible, racing with each other.


The Scene is further organized into sub-scenes, with release groups specializing in one or another media format (the Game Scene, the MP3 Scene, etc.) Each sub-scene has its own bylaws, written codes, and understood folkways -- these vary across time, and may be litigated by the participants (though infrequently; as a Schelling point, the rules are difficult to influence, and may only be amended by a 'Council' of prominent representatives). Rules for media govern bitrate, filesize, encoding format, and almost always require a photo included in the distributed content as proof that the uploader possesses a physical copy of the release. Failing to meet the written standards gets a release 'nuked' -- removed from the topsite with the uploader demerited. The result is a remarkably uniform, professional system of distribution.


Topsites take on the role of something like a state, a shared space that enforces the written code and governs access to resources, while competing with other topsites in a parallel prestige subeconomy. The topsite's fundamental administration mechanism is controlling access to finite account 'slots' on its infrastructure; the draw is its massive archive of content, and especially having that content before the rest of the world. Access to this trove -- both a carrot and a stick -- keeps participants within the permissible bounds of behavior. Slots are so scarce that being in a top scene group does not guarantee access; some number may be awarded to the group to distribute among members, who must maintain their slots by contributing gigabytes of fresh media every week -- an impossibility for anybody not within or directly adjacent to release groups. 


The game carries a fundamental tension. The tangible reward for competing is *access*, because the Scene's organs are exclusive. The first rule of any topsite is not to talk about the topsite. The identities of participants and addresses of infrastructure are all closely held and totally inaccessible to outsiders. Scene participants view themselves as the elite, who have arrived in their positions through demonstrations of ability. The competition is purely for an audience made up of others like themselves; even sharing releases to outsiders is a sin. But Scene groups are aware that their releases percolate to the wider world, and that savvy teenagers everywhere know who CODEX or RAZOR 1911 are (renowned and accomplished release groups, in case you don't). While the game is formally played for themselves in secret, there is tacit understanding that their glories echo to the world outside. The Scene, after all, could not persist across time if its allure and cultural cache did not draw in new blood.


Beginning their lives in the 1980s on *ad hoc* BBS exchanges where pseudonymous, talented PC enthusiasts could exchange media through phone lines and acoustic couplers, release groups grew in sophistication as the game became more formalized. The Scene adjusted to a harsher reality following police raids in the nineties. A BBS on a phone line is trivially traceable -- the remaining BBS groups migrated to the Internet, to IRC and FTP, the protocols it operates through to today. 


IRC and FTP are relics of a prior age, though still are both in routine (if niche) use. IRC, internet relay chat, is an early chat protocol that makes use of the client-server model -- a user connects via client software to a server, where messages are relayed to and from other clients. Scene participants take pains to anonymize themselves on IRC, bouncing their connections through proxies to avoid leaking information about their corporeal location. Communication and coordination takes place in IRC channels; however, the real action takes place on FTP servers. File transfer protocol is a method devised in the nineteen-seventies for sending files across a network -- this is how groups put their releases on topsites. FTP and IRC servers do not have an interface or web page, but are connected to via client software which may have a command line interface or a desktop GUI. IRC and FTP are *protocols*, rule-sets for computers to talk to each other. Open protocol specification (as opposed to self-contained platform) allows for flexibility in implementation, and creates space for operators and participants to develop and extend tools. 


The switch to the Internet was viewed as a jump into an impenetrable chasm of illegibility; 2^32 potential addresses, 2^16 usable ports. Legal scrutiny with periodic arrests or topsite shutdowns would teach them more robust obfuscation techniques as time went on.

Pirated content flows out from the Scene. An informal but tiered system of distribution lies between release groups and the layman. Each of them relies on at least one of the structures above it, and parasitizes its work in the same way as primary distributors are parasitized by the Scene. Despite this, all 'downstream' distributors are looked on with disdain; the Scene is nothing if not elitist. 


The rung beneath the topsites are the FXP boards -- an inferior replica of the topsites. While mirroring the competitive structure, participants instead compete to provide links to hacked FTP servers which host Scene content, not content produced by the participants. Users race to distribute and mirror Scene releases from the topsites, hosting them on hacked servers with substantial uplink speeds and available disk space. This carries much greater risk than secretive, hidden servers; criminal hacking plays a central role.


Beneath or next to the boards are private torrent trackers. `oink.me.uk`, `what.cd`, and their contemporary descendants are the exemplars of private trackers for music piracy. Private trackers mirror the scene in their legalistic regulations for permissible uploaded content. Many of the most adaptive traits of the Scene-as-game were coopted by private trackers; the introduction of the Gazelle tracker suite by `what.cd` formalized a gamified table of ranks for participants, granting titles and privileges for contributing to the communal project of accumulation.


Public trackers, as exemplified by The Pirate Bay in the aughts, give the average 'net user access to the fruits of the Scene. Scene naming conventions still dominate their listings -- if you've ever wondered why torrented archives follow naming schemes with `-SKiDROW` appended, or periods rather than spaces, these are formal naming conventions preserved from the topsites where the files were originally released (e.g., appending the name of a release group). Prior to Bittorrent's dominance over filesharing, this tier was shared with other P2P networks (Napster, Limewire, Gnutella), which have mostly been relegated to footnotes as public torrents and seedy streaming sites have captured low-investment public pirates.


At the bottom of the food chain are bootleggers -- car-trunk street merchants and DVD vendors. The Scene looks on at this with particular contempt; introducing money into the game reduces the human drama and shared meaning with mere commerce. This may strike the outsider as confusing or hypocritical, but is easily pattern-matched to subcultural notions of 'selling out'. Like all rungs beneath the topsites, the bootlegger is a free-rider and profaner. 


It should be noted that this description better suits the landscape as it existed in the mid-aughts; the world has shifted as more of the world has come online. Most dramatically, private trackers have moved up the food chain as FXP boards have faded. Unpatched servers don't last long in the dark forest, bandwidth and disk has become cheap, and exploit markets and cryptocurrency have given rise to business models beyond mere status games; burning a server on hosting cracked video games is simply no longer a coherent value proposition. Eve reports that these boards also heavily relied on university networks, which have since hardened and become less accommodating of unregistered servers.


Private trackers now eclipse the Scene in terms of breadth and quality of releases, particularly for video and music. The closure of `what.cd` inspired a thousand thinkpieces comparing it to the Library of Alexandria -- an unparalleled catalog of recorded music; every album and EP, available in a range of encoding quality and format, searchable by any index. No such song ever rang for the MP3 Scene. The primary distinction between private trackers and the Scene are the motivations for participation; while trackers are filled with enthusiasts, interested in the medium itself, the Scene is almost agnostic to what is contained by releases. The ability to demonstrate technical skills, superior organizational coherence, or exclusive access to supply chains are the only metrics that matter. The Scene's obsessions are infrastructural competition and exclusivity, not an artist or label's catalog.

ASCII or ANSI characters are the primordial media of digital art. Prior to the web or multimedia computing, Usenet and BBS denizens made use of the primitive accommodations of text mode displays and limited color palettes to create simple images; information and art began their lives on the network as a single format. The roots of the Scene lie in this era and in these spaces. 


The art of the Scene carries motifs, which by now have become rigid and institutionalized. NFO ('info') files distributed with releases are adorned with ASCII art decoration -- frames surrounding the body of text; illustrations of skulls, demons, weapons; fluid calligraphic sketches evocative of subway graffiti announcing the name of the group, with individual members in annotation. These artifacts are the primary aesthetic signature of the Scene for outsiders, and the one most familiar to teenagers torrenting the latest GTA or Batman installment. Little has changed in style or format since the early days; an NFO file from a contemporary release is nearly interchangeable with one from decades prior, using standardized encoding that could be opened with the same PC applications.


Releases carry adornment beyond text files, particularly software and video games. Installers and 'cracks' (software that defeats copy protection) that are distributed in releases more often than not come with images or animations, often accompanied by synthesized music, which impress upon the end consumer the level of sophistication that the group operates with. These work to re-brand the release, with the release group given top billing over the publishers or developers. They are often impressive enough to appreciate in their own right; YouTube is filled with recordings and compilations of keygen music in particular, the songs that accompany a particular type of crack software that generates registration codes.


Just as text and art on the network were of a single piece prior to speciating, the Scene and the Demoscene were once a single body. The Demoscene is the Scene as a pure producer of art. Similarly competitive and institutional, Demoscene groups create audio-visual animations using procedurally-generative computational tricks to squeeze shockingly impressive effects out of binary executables the size of a small image. Download an `.exe` file, run it on your PC, and your screen is taken over by a short, film-like animation of mountains, buildings, lights, which may strain the capabilities of your hardware. The Demoscene competition is over how impressive this animation can be, and how much can be wrenched out of the tiny file limits. Categories are specified by filesize; 64 kilobytes is a common format, but the most impressive are fully three-dimensional animations and synthesized music squeezed into less than 4 kilobytes. Achieving these results requires a nearly magical ability to manipulate the lowest levels of PC hardware, and the resulting works are extraordinarily detailed considering their constraints (search YouTube for '4k demoscene' for examples, and bear in mind that the web page delivering the recording is orders of magnitudes larger in size than the original file, much less the video recording itself).


The Demoscene shares a quiet but persistent relationship with its darker brother; they frequently share members, as the low-level hacking skills required for one are useful for the other. The Demoscene itself is completely legitimate, though, and organizes in the open. Assembly, a semiannual conference and competition in Finland, is recognized as an object of 'Intangible Cultural Heritage' by UNESCO. The Demoscene sprung directly from the early game-cracking scene, however, and maintains a semblance of its organizational structure.

Eve's book is an adequate, high-level survey of the mechanical processes and defined rules of the game as it is played, but suffers a few weaknesses. First and foremost it lacks narrative due to its primary sources; rather than seeking participants or finding individual stories, he consults existing academic literature and an archive of textfiles from releases and topsites that was collected during the first decade of the century. This leaves his perspective both locked in a particular time and lacking a sense of chronology. The impermeability of release groups and topsites make this difficult to rectify, but one is left disappointed if looking for a historical accounting or genealogy. 

To his credit, there seem to be no other commercially published works on this subject, a surprising fact considering its long history and real-world influence. Eve takes the subject seriously, though he routinely indulges in grad student brainworm rituals, *e.g.* scolding over the 'colonialism' of ASCII text encoding. Despite Eve holding himself aloof from his subject, the reader can deduce a deep familiarity and interest in the topic, if a discomfort with his sense of identification. 

Eve's discussion and understanding of the technology involved is competent and grounded. A long discussion of the infrastructure of the Scene includes descriptions of the strengths and limitations of protocols, and a detour to describe the custom FTP software written for various topsites during the nineties and early aughts. Here again, however, he is hindered by the fundamental weakness in his research, a total reliance on decontextualized fragments of text. There are surely volumes that could be written about the history of the Scene's covert infrastructure and its ability to persist over time, but we are only offered a taste. Most importantly, the infrastructure of the Scene is a trade-off between resilience and efficiency, the fundamental tension in distributed systems. What is interesting about topsites and release groups is the mirroring of the decentralized, federated structure across technological and social lines, which allows the Scene to persist in the face of police crackdowns.


Eve's central thesis is that the Scene exists as an alternate reality game (ARG) -- an imposition of rules upon real-life actions, to create a shared framework with other participants, towards some end -- in this case, demonstration of value toward the accumulation of prestige. The contents of releases are secondary to the fact that your group releases it first, and the true prize is recognition. The game is self-contained, ritualistic, and endless.


The argument is convincing but unexciting. Like much of the book, it hearkens to academic discourse regarding the internet from the turn of the century. Eve returns to this point repeatedly in scholarly fashion, but the true allure of his subject is his pulling a curtain back, and making legible an opaque society with deep history and sophistication. The sociology and internal histories of the Scene would make a better point of focus than litigating subcultural studies frameworks; however, this avenue is hindered by the lack of human narratives. The closest we get to this (outside of a handful of anecdotes) is a history of police raids, recounted through media reports.

The Scene is one of the oldest continuous network-native social forms. The most instructive lessons for outsiders are to be drawn from the Scene's longevity and retention of its basic form, even in the face of legal reaction, technological disruptions, and changes to mainstream distribution of media. 

One of the most striking features to an observer is the nearly-static nature of the Scene's mode of organization and aesthetic signatures. NFO files from contemporary releases are scarcely distinguishable from releases from the 1990s; formatting conventions are largely in stasis, with multi-part RAR archives the standard and naming schemes formalized. The protocols, social-economic games, and governance structures it has designed or evolved to maximize a balance of resilience and speed have managed to persist across decades, and outlasted the media and distribution landscape it was designed around.


The preservation of form can be attributed to several factors: while the Scene exists on the same physical infrastructure as the rest of the 'net, it sits outside of it by means of protocol and gate-keeping. The Scene's infrastructure is not a collection of React websites or iOS apps, it is an ossified, standardized assembly of rules, network protocols, and traditions. The post-BBS Internet Scene took root at a time before the web became a synonym for the internet. The protocols it chose were similarly decentralized, but over time it has benefited from their obscurity as they have fallen out of common use. In addition to avoiding adversarial attention, these protocols are set apart from the vulgar networks: sacred space. 


Beyond partition at the protocol layer, the Scene has institutions: release groups and topsites. Institutions allow a culture to pass itself across time without being bound to charismatic figures or individual power brokers. It is difficult to say how closely this aligns with the actual function of release groups with the distance of an outsider, but the lifecycles of successful groups are measured in years and decades, and members can be observed coming and going in NFO files. Release groups form to fill the need for specialized labor or access; it is unlikely that a single person, no matter how skilled, would have the specific combination of access, time, experience, and resources that allow a group to operate at a competitive level. They persist because they bring rewards to their members, bestowing pooled resources, communal benefits (topsite & media access), and corporate prestige for their members.

Institutionalization sheds light on another feature of the Scene -- its criminality. Individuals outside of or against the state tend to wither without a social structure to replace legitimate state functions. Successful outsiders form groups, and successful groups adapt and create structures to preserve themselves. Yakuza, 'Ndrangheta, and thieves-in-law

Perhaps most importantly as far as mechanisms of persistence, the Scene has developed a social identity in-group dynamic, with barriers constructed and maintained between participants and the wider world. Even co-pirates on P2P networks are considered beneath them, held in the same regard as for-profit bootleggers or the normies buying physical media. The only meaningful token is participation, which is bound up with a social order illegible to the uninitiated. Demands for personal investment, recognition for individual achievement, and jargon for their trade all contribute to a system of meaning and tribal belonging. Participants find ways to memorialize the people and events in their hidden world, publishing newsletters with excerpts from exclusive IRC channels, and . "Creating an alternative reality is not enough. One must, it seems, cement it with magazines, documentation, and other persistent artifacts to perpetuate the game." Beyond publications and self-documentation, the game bleeds into the real world, where they are recognized as an unstoppable force of nature -- alternately ingenious hacker Robin Hoods, or malign criminals bent on impoverishing artists. The 


The Scene is no longer the prime mover of digital content in the way that it was at the turn of the century, but the social form persists. The game will go on as long as the status it bestows carries weight for talented teenagers and bored office workers. What is surprising about it is not the fact that it arose, but that it continues to self-organize and operate, while remaining beyond the gaze of the public or state.
