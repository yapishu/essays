## part 1: why we host

Feedback loops between technology and social organization are a throughline in history. Technology might be purely social -- a set of written or informal social contracts and axioms, a tradition, a metaphysics, acting as a Schelling point for coordination. Coordination is built on trust. Trust is built on predictive modeling, and shared assumptions lend greater certainty to modeling.

At an increasing tempo, the social technologies that shape our modes of organization reflect material technologies -- the printing press breaks the clerical monopoly on narrative, kicking off a century of realignment and bloodshed. Industrial output saturates global commercial flows and depopulates the countryside. Electrical communication collapses distance and time.  Computational systems expose and reorient information flows across social graphs, and act as logarithmic amplification circuits on prior cycles. Cognition has decoupled from sentience and become a metered utility, presaging even deeper intensification cycles.

The impact of material technologies might be measured by a polarity between entrenching or disrupting a social order. A dispruptive technology par excellence is the rifle -- a millenium of hereditary martial aristocrats outmoded as a class by whoever can field the most conscripted laborers, followed by centuries of advanced states pushed out of territories by motivated and coordinated riflemen. History only has a few moments like this, where the the leverage offered by a new technology is broadly available to individuals, exerts centrifugal force on existing power structures, and resists being put back into the box. 

The position being put forth here is that right now, you are living in a period of such technology, with access to tools that represent an equivalent rupture. You have access to powers that could only be described as magic a few decades ago. Most of these are symmetrical vis-a-vis your relationship with alien powers, or are disfavorable to you -- think of data aggregators and markets that serve only states and corporate analytics engineers -- but the field of privacy-oriented tech, built on the foundation of modern cryptography, is the contemporary rifle. Observing the currents in the moment you exist in, and the methods of maximum leverage available to you, are necessary to preserve and compound your agency across time.

'Security through obscurity' gets trotted out as a design fallacy, but it remains an important part of a defense-in-depth. Being hidden, being hard to understand, can be a powerful shield; "being described is the prelude to being attacked." The US Federal government is estimated to classify 50 million documents a year; you are already in an arms race even if you don't know it. Information asymmetry tautologically advantages one agent over another.

The same tools that can be used against you can also defend you. When more of us use these tools, when they become the norm, we build compounding network effects. It's easier to go your own way when that's just what people do. Open protocols, running your own communications -- these only become possible when we understand and trust our tools. And the only way to really trust them is to put our hands on them, read them, and understand them.

> i created my interior thoughts as a means of production for the corporation that owned the board i was posting to, and that commodity was being sold to other commodity/consumer entities as entertainment. that means that i sold my soul like a tennis shoe and i derived no profit from the sale of my soul. people who post frequently on boards appear to know that they are factory equipment and tennis shoes, and sometimes trade sends and email about how their contributions are not appreciated by management.

> as if this were not enough, all of my words were made immortal by means of tape backups. furthermore, i was paying two bucks an hour for the privilege of commodifying and exposing myself. worse still, i was subjecting myself to the possibility of scrutiny by such friendly folks as the FBI: they can, and have, downloaded pretty much whatever they damn well please. the rhetoric in cyberspace is liberation-speak. the reality is that cyberspace is an increasingly efficient tool of surveillance with which people have a voluntary relationship.

- timeline: mainframes, personal computers, phones
- services converge toward cloud, saas
- previously-difficult foundational technology emerge to defy conventional practices wrt privacy & property
- a server is a role
- willing the computer to act on your behalf
- servers should be simple; enter urbit
- urbit should be simple; enter groundseg
- [3 stage stoneworking -- ask nallux]
