# Self-hosting manifesto

## part 1: why we host

Feedback loops between technology and social organization are a throughline in history. Technology might be purely social -- a set of written or informal social contracts and axioms, a tradition, a metaphysics, acting as a Schelling point for coordination. Coordination is built on trust; trust is built on predictive modeling, and shared assumptions lend greater confidence to modeled probabilities.

At an increasing tempo, the development and adoption of the social technologies that shape our modes of organization reflect material technologies -- the printing press breaks the clerical monopoly on meaning and narrative, kicking off a century of realignment and bloodshed. Industrial output saturates global commercial flows and depopulates the countryside. Electrical communication collapses distance and time, pulling the periphery into the core and homogenizing language and discourse.  Computer networks act as exponential amplification circuits on prior cycles as they expose and reorient information flows across social graphs. Cognition has decoupled from sentience and become a metered utility, presaging even deeper centripetal cycles of intensification. 

The impact of material technologies might be measured by a polarity between entrenching or disrupting a social order. A dispruptive technology par excellence is the rifle -- a millenium of hereditary martial aristocrats outmoded as a class by whoever can field the most conscripted laborers, traditional societies across the globe overthrown and brought under the gunpowder empires, and centuries of advanced states pushed out of territories by motivated and coordinated riflemen. History only presents a few moments like this, where the the leverage offered by a new technology is broadly available to individuals, exerts centrifugal force on existing power structures, and resists being put back into the box. 

The position being put forth here is that right now, you are living in a period of such technology, with access to tools that represent an equivalent rupture. You have access to powers that could only be described as magic a few decades ago. Observing the currents in the moment you exist in, and the methods of maximum leverage available to you, are necessary to preserve and compound your agency across time. Most of these tools are symmetrical at best vis-a-vis your relationship with other actors, or are disfavorable to you -- think of data aggregators and markets that serve only states and corporate analytics engineers -- but the field of privacy-oriented tech, built on the foundation of modern cryptography, is the contemporary rifle, or the equivalent of the printing press. 

'Security through obscurity' gets trotted out as a design fallacy, but it remains an important part of a defense-in-depth. As a general principle, information asymmetry advantages one agent over another. Observation allows for prediction. Being hidden, being hard to understand, can be a powerful shield; "being described is the prelude to being attacked." The US Federal government is estimated to classify 50 million documents a year; you are already in an arms race, even if you don't know it. This analogy runs both ways -- in an attempt to roll back public advances, strong cryptography was classified as a munition by the US State Department and remains subject to export restrictions. 

Trusting your tools enough to defend yourself with them means being able to understand them well enough to model their behavior -- allowing someone else to run your tools behind some proprietary commercial service is effectively opting-out of the possibility. 

The best way to understand a tool is to use it. Our goal is to put the tools in your hands.

Native Planet is an ideologically-motivated project. Our social coordination nexus -- our cooperative Schelling point -- is the desire to make self-hosting easier and better than letting someone else run software for you. The price of the latter has become clear -- be observed, monitored, bucketed, modeled. The advantage of the former will become increasingly obvious as time goes on. [tie this back to 'modeling' for trust]

> i created my interior thoughts as a means of production for the corporation that owned the board i was posting to, and that commodity was being sold to other commodity/consumer entities as entertainment. that means that i sold my soul like a tennis shoe and i derived no profit from the sale of my soul. people who post frequently on boards appear to know that they are factory equipment and tennis shoes, and sometimes trade sends and email about how their contributions are not appreciated by management.

> as if this were not enough, all of my words were made immortal by means of tape backups. furthermore, i was paying two bucks an hour for the privilege of commodifying and exposing myself. worse still, i was subjecting myself to the possibility of scrutiny by such friendly folks as the FBI: they can, and have, downloaded pretty much whatever they damn well please. the rhetoric in cyberspace is liberation-speak. the reality is that cyberspace is an increasingly efficient tool of surveillance with which people have a voluntary relationship.
